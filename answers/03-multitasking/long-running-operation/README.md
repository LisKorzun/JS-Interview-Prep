# Long running operationâ€Š: how to handle it?

By default the browser uses a single thread to run all the JavaScript in your page as well as to perform layout, 
reflows, and garbage collection. This means that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, 
leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience.

[An example site](http://mdn.github.io/performance-scenarios/js-worker/index.html) whose long-running JavaScript causes responsiveness problems. 
We can apply two different approaches to fixing them. The first is to split long-running functions 
into pieces and use `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule each piece, 
and the second is to run the whole function in a separate thread using a `web worker`.

__`Using requestAnimationFrame`__

In the first attempt at fixing this, we'll split up the function into a number of much smaller self-contained functions, 
and schedule each one using `requestAnimationFrame()`.

`requestAnimationFrame()` tells the browser to run the given function in each frame, just before it performs a repaint. 
As long as each function is reasonably small, the browser should be able to keep inside its frame budget.

Each function should be short enough that the browser can handle it without the overall frame rate dropping.

Using requestAnimationFrame worked to solve the responsiveness problem here, 
but there are a couple of potential problems with it:

* it can be difficult to split up a long-running function into separate self-contained functions. 
Even this very simple case produced more complex code.
* the split-up version takes much longer to run. In fact we can be quite precise about how long it takes: 
there are 50 iterations, and the browser is producing about 60 frames per second. So it will take almost 
a second to run all the computations, and that's visible in both the user experience and in the profile.

__`Using web workers`__

Web workers enable you to run JavaScript in a separate thread. 
The main thread and the worker thread can't call each other directly, but communicate using an asynchronous messaging API.

```javascript
const iterations = 50;
const multiplier = 1000000000;

var worker = new Worker("js/calculate.js");

function doPointlessComputationsInWorker() {

  function handleWorkerCompletion(message) {
    if (message.data.command == "done") {
      pointlessComputationsButton.disabled = false;
      console.log(message.data.primes);
      worker.removeEventListener("message", handleWorkerCompletion);
    }
  }

  worker.addEventListener("message", handleWorkerCompletion, false);

  worker.postMessage({
    "multiplier": multiplier,
    "iterations": iterations
  });
}
```
The main difference here, compared with the original, is that we need to:

* create a worker
* send it a message when we are ready to calculate
* listen for a message called "done", which indicates that the worker has finished.

Then we need a new file `"calculate.js"`, that looks like this:

```javascript
self.addEventListener("message", go);

function go(message) {
  var iterations = message.data.iterations;
  var multiplier = message.data.multiplier;
  primes = calculatePrimes(iterations, multiplier);

  self.postMessage({
    "command":"done",
    "primes": primes
  });
}

function calculatePrimes(iterations, multiplier) {
 //do something very long
  return primes;
}
```
In the worker, we have to listen for a message telling us to start, and send a "done" message back when we are done.

![Using web workers](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/10899/perf-js-worker-overview.png)

Each button-press is visible in the overview as two very short orange markers:

1. the `doPointlessComputationsInWorker()` function that handles the click event and starts the worker's processing
2. the `handleWorkerCompletion()` function that runs when the worker calls "done".

In between, the worker runs all the primality tests, and it doesn't seem to have any effect at all 
on the responsiveness of the main thread. This might seem unlikely, but because workers run in a separate thread, 
they can take advantage of multi-core processors, which a single-threaded web site can't.

**_The main limitation of web workers is that DOM APIs are not available to code running in a worker._**

__`Updating DOM during long running operation`__

JavaScript is single threaded. This means that during operation execution the single thread is busy and 
cannot handle UI events like mouse move and mouse click. From end user perspective the UI is dead.

Modern solution is to use Web Worker. As long as your algorithm is pure (only accesses JavaScript objects) then you are OK. 
However, if the algorithm needs to access DOM objects you cannot use web workers since they have no access to the DOM.

How can I implement a long running operation which must be executed under the "UI" thread but 
still give some feedback to the user during execution: 
* User clicks the Start button which executes the `longRunningOperation` function
* No progress is displayed. UI is considered non responsive
* Only after `longRunningOperation` completes a "FINISHED" message is displayed

*__This is the expected behavior since JavaScript is single threaded and the DOM has no chance to refresh itself 
until `longRunningOperation` finishes.__*

The solution is to break the function into multiple "short running" operations and ask the browser to refresh 
between each step.

```javascript
    function longRunningOperation() {
        var begin = new Date();
        var progress = 0;
        console.log("RUNNING");
        
        function step() {
            if (++progress == 250) {
                var time = new Date() - begin;
                console.log(time);
                console.log('FINISHING')
                return;
            }
            sleep(10);
            console.log(progress);
            setTimeout(step);
        }
        setTimeout(step);
    }
    
    function sleep(timeout) {
        var begin = new Date();
        while (new Date() - begin < timeout) {
        }
    }
    longRunningOperation();
```
Zero timeout means "I want to execute my code at a later time after the browser processes its event queue and **UI is updated**".

Each step is 10 milliseconds long. Assuming DOM update is efficient we expect the whole operation to complete 
in 250*10 = ~2500 milliseconds. But script takes 3769 milliseconds to completes.

Where is the code that cost us more than 1 second of processing?
The answer lies inside the setTimeout function. Apparently, setTimeout has a maximum frequency.
According to the standard it is recommended that `setTimeout` waits __at least 4 milliseconds__ before raising the event. 

In case our algorithm is divided into smaller steps the `setTimeout` overhead is bigger. 
For example, our code simulate a step of 10 milliseconds while `setTimeout` overhead is 4 milliseconds. 
This is a 40% overhead. For a 5 milliseconds step, the overhead is 80%

Probably the best solution is to use Web Workers for executing long running operation. 
As I mentioned before, it is not a relevant solution when the long running operation is DOM related.
